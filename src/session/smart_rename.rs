//! Automatic "smart" rename of a structured-view (ACP) session from its first
//! turn.
//!
//! When a session still carries its auto-generated civilization name (see
//! [`crate::session::civilizations`]) the session's own agent is run once in
//! non-interactive one-shot mode (e.g. `claude -p`) to produce a short title,
//! and the session is renamed. The one-shot fires at turn-end and summarizes
//! the whole first turn (prompt plus agent output), so it never races the
//! live worker for the provider API (#2348). This is best-effort and
//! fire-and-forget: it never blocks or fails the user's prompt, and any
//! failure leaves the generated name in place.
//!
//! Title only: the worktree directory is intentionally not moved. The live ACP
//! worker holds the worktree as its working directory, so a directory move
//! would fail exactly like a manual rename of a running tied session does. The
//! visible session title is what gains meaning here.
