//! Server-owned prompt dispatch: whether an incoming prompt is sent now,
//! steered into the running turn, or parked on the server queue.
//!
//! Tier 3 of the structured-view server-ownership plan
//! (`docs/development/server-owned-prompt-dispatch.md`). The decision used to
//! live in each client, re-derived from an event projection, and every clause
//! of it is a fixed incident rather than a design preference. Getting it wrong
//! does not drift a label: it wedges a session or respawns a worker. So it
//! lives here once, as a pure function over the daemon's own control state,
//! and the clients render what the endpoint tells them it did.

///   the fresh worker. Parking instead leaves the prompt in a queue whose
///   drain is waiting for the very worker nothing is going to start.
/// - **#2805**: a steerable agent takes a mid-turn prompt directly. Parking it
///   reintroduces the queue-after behavior steering exists to replace.
/// - **#1727**: except while a cancel is pending. The daemon reads a prompt
///   arriving mid-cancel as a wedged agent and **restarts the runner**, so
///   Stop-then-type must park or it respawns the worker.
/// - **#3219**: and except during `/compact`. The adapter answers `Injected`
///   and swallows the message into a turn that never replies to it, with no
///   retry affordance.
///
/// The failure modes are asymmetric: wrongly sending where the old code parked
/// can restart a worker, while wrongly parking only delays a turn. So every
/// path that is not positively classified as sendable falls through to
