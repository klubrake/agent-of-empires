//! Pure reducer over `AcpBroadcastFrame` → `AcpTranscript`.
//!
//! Mirrors the semantics of `web/src/hooks/useAcp.ts` but in
//! Rust + with the TUI's flat-row data shape. The server-side
//! `AcpState` in `src/acp/state.rs` is intentionally NOT a UI
//! reducer (it drops `AgentMessageChunk` text, for one), so the TUI
//! structured view owns its own activity accumulator.
//!
//! Design choices for the TUI MVP:
//!
//! - Rich tool-card breakdowns (per-kind layout, diff previews, file
//!   trees) are deferred to followup issues. Tool calls render as
//!   structured one-liner cards here; users can press `o` from the
//!   transcript pane to open the web view for full-fidelity inspection.
//! - `AvailableCommandsUpdated` is retained on the transcript even
//!   though the MVP composer doesn't surface a slash-command picker;
//!   the followup that adds slash autocomplete (#1018 followup) needs
//!   this list in place.
//! - `SessionContextReset` flips `context_primer_pending` so the view
//!   layer can offer the "paste a context primer" affordance.
